#+TITLE: gallery.roosta.sh

* Overview
  Gallery site for displaying various graphical works I've done over the years.
  Designed to be responsive, with a minimal design to highlight the art work.

* Libraries used
  Besides the language itself and namespaces included therein I used these libraries and tools.
  Huge thanks to all the developers of these.

* Setup
  First install [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][Leiningen]]

  To get an interactive development environment run:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  lein figwheel
  #+END_SRC

  and open your browser at [[localhost:3449][http://localhost:3449/]].
  This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the need to reload.

  The stylesheets are automatically compiled when the project is first build but to have it update as you develop run:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  lein garden auto
  #+END_SRC

  CSS is saved as ~resources/public/css/compiled/screen.css~

  To create a production build run:
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  lein prod
  #+END_SRC

  And open your browser in ~prod/index.html~
